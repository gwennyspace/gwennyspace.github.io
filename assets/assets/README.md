# Sifra's Space — GitHub Pages site

How to deploy:
1. Create a new GitHub repository (public).
2. Upload these files to the repo root (or clone and push).
3. In GitHub → Settings → Pages: set branch `main` (or `gh-pages`) and folder `/ (root)`.
4. Save and wait a few minutes — your site will be available at:
   `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>` (or `https://<username>.github.io/` if repo named `<username>.github.io`).

Notes:
- Replace gallery images with your own photos (just overwrite `src` in gallery/preview).
- For a working contact form, use services like Formspree, Netlify Forms, or implement a simple backend.
- Want me to: minify, add animations, or convert to a single-page React with nicer transitions? Ask and I'll make it!
